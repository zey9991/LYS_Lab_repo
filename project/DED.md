| Correct Ver. | That’s **right**! This weekend is **earth day**, not your birthday. Don’t get it twisted. **Earth day**! |
| My Ver.      | That’s why this weekend is earth’s day, not your birthday. Don’t get it twisted. Earth’s day! |

在这句话中，**"Earth Day"** 应该写成 **"Earth Day"** 而不是 **"Earth's Day"**。
这是因为 **"Earth Day"** 是一个正式的节日名称，指的是全球庆祝环境保护的“地球日”。在这种情况下，"Earth" 是一个专有名词，表示“地球”，并且节日名称中不需要所有格（'s）。

**"Earth's Day"** 通常表示“地球的日子”，这在语法上不太准确，因为“Earth Day”作为固定的节日名称已经广泛接受。
